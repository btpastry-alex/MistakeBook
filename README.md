# MistakeBook (iOS)

MistakeBook is a mobile learning companion app built around cyclic review, inspired by the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. Users can import question images from the camera, photo library, or by pasting—no more cutting and pasting paper notes. With the convenience of a mobile device, you can review, browse, and collect your mistakes anytime. The app provides precise cropping tools to capture the exact area you need, and supports handwritten annotations and masking on images. All content and metadata (subject, learning topic, error reason, creation time, etc.) are stored locally on the device and can be used offline without an internet connection.
According to the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, memory declines rapidly after learning and should be reinforced through spaced repetition. It is commonly recommended to do a quick review within 20 minutes after learning, then review again after 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month. This helps transfer short-term memory into long-term memory—the longer the interval you can maintain, the more stable the memory becomes.
MistakeBook provides:

Today / Upcoming: Browsing, review, and reminder features. Each review session can be recorded with a photo or text note. Based on the familiarity rating you confirm after reviewing, the system automatically schedules the next review date. If an item is marked as fully mastered (5 stars), it is automatically moved to Completed and removed from future review schedules.


All: Export questions, answers, and review records to an A4 PDF. You can also export/import via a compressed archive to share mistake sets with others.


Stats: Identify learning difficulties and blind spots through statistics, improving review efficiency.


Worksheet Builder: Select mistakes and export them as a printable PDF, or as an editable ODF document for creating worksheets and practicing by hand.
