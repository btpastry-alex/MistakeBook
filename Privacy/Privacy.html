Privacy Policy
This app is committed to protecting your privacy. Using common App Store “App Privacy” categories and wording, this policy explains how the app handles data and uses system permissions.
1. Data Not Collected
This app does not collect any user data (Data Not Collected).
 It does not gather, upload, or store personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, phone number, or address), and it does not collect usage data (such as browsing, taps, or interaction logs) for analytics or advertising.
2. Not Linked to You
Since this app does not collect data, nothing is linked to your identity (Not Linked to You).
 The app does not provide account login, membership profiles, or cloud sync, and it does not create user profiles.
3. Not Used for Tracking
This app is not used for tracking (Not Used for Tracking).
 It does not track you across apps or websites, and it does not share any data with third parties for advertising or measurement.
4. On-device Processing & Storage
Content you create or import in this app (e.g., question/answer images, annotations, notes, categories, familiarity, and review records) is processed and stored on-device in your device’s local storage (app sandbox).
 The app does not automatically upload your content to any server.
5. Permissions
The app may request the following system permissions, and will access them only when you actively use the related features:
Camera: Take photos of questions/answers and add them to the app.


Photos: Select images from your photo library and add them to the app.


Pasteboard: Read copied content when you use the “Paste” feature; the app does not continuously read the pasteboard in the background.


Files: Import/export files you select in the Files app. The app only accesses the files you choose and does not scan other files.


You can manage or revoke these permissions at any time in iOS Settings. Revoking permissions may limit related features.
6. Import/Export & Sharing
Files are generated and handed off to iOS for saving or sharing only when you actively use Export/Share.
 If you save exported files to third-party services (e.g., cloud drives or messaging apps), those services handle the data according to their own policies.
7. Data Deletion
You can delete content within the app. Uninstalling the app removes data stored in the app sandbox on your device.
 (If you exported backups to external locations, you must delete those copies yourself.)
8. Changes
If future versions add data collection, third-party analytics, or cloud sync, this policy will be updated and the app will notify you.
